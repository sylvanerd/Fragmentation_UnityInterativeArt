# Fragmentation_UnityInterativeArt
‘FRAGMENATION’ is a virtual interactive artwork exploring how social media influences our attention span.
This project presents my reflective thinking on our everyday social media consumption habits. 

Once you have downloaded the file, you can interact with virtual objects using your mouse and keyboard.

W and S for walking forward and backward.
A and D for turning your 'head' up and down.
